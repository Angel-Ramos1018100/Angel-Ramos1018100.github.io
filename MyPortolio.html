			<h3>Project 1</h3>
			<p>The Jessica Sedano online nursing portfolio was a project I undertook to create a showcase of Jessica's nursing skills, qualifications, and experience using HTML5. With HTML5, I was able to incorporate interactive elements such as forms and images, which made the portfolio engaging and easy to navigate. CSS allowed me to create an aesthetically pleasing layout that enhanced the user experience. I'm happy to say that the project was a success and achieved its goal of presenting Jessica's nursing abilities in a professional and engaging manner.</p>
